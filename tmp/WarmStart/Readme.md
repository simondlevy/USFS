These are the most recent host-side programs for the EM7180 reference board AKA Ultimate Sensor Fusion Solution available at [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/ultimate-sensor-fusion-solution/) and updated with the warm-start function which stores the dynamic calibration parameters on the on-board EEPROM so the device starts well-calibrated (given similar environmental conditions) upon subsequent power on. The code is designed to be used with the Teensy 3.Xmicrcontroller but with few changes any I2C-compatible micrcontroller will do.
